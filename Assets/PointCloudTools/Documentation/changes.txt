*** PointCloud Viewer & Tools for Unity ***

v1.7

- Added: PointCloud2Mesh now has basic LOD mesh generation (with adjustable LOD amount)
- Added: Link for custom PointMeshSizeDX11 shaders (can adjust point size for mesh points in DX11 mode, since point size is not supported in DX11) *See Materials/Shaders/Extras-folder)

- Fixed: Unity5.2 or later couldnt set output filename in save dialog
- Fixed: CloudCompare PLY file had extra comment in header, it gets correctly skipped now

- Note: LOD meshes are not saved to project folder, they currently live in the scene only
- Note: Optimize Points & Decimate points are not supported with Brekel PointCloud2Binary importer

- Known issues: Optimize Points does not work properly, loses precision in some cases

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

v1.6
- Added: New material "PointCloudColorsMeshAlpha.material" (and shader "PointCloudMeshColorsAlpha.shader") with adjustable color tint & alpha
- Added: PointCloud2Mesh now imports .LAS & .PTS files
- Added: **Experimental** PseudoLight & VertexPush scene "scene_MeshPointPush" for mesh clouds (sets point brightness based on distance to give object and pushes(displaces) points away form given object)
- Added: Basic decimate cloud for PointCloud2Mesh (remove every #nth point)
- Added: Display selected file size (below sourcefile field)
- Added: **Experimental** [x] Optimize Points for PointCloud2Mesh (easier to see from scene view while playing), it sorts the points along X axis (to allow mesh pieces to get culled easier), but doesnt work well with all values, if your cloud seems to be missing points, disable Optimize points.

- Changed: Project is now updated to Unity5.1
- Changed: Point data is now internally read as doubles instead of floats (to avoid loss of precision during scaling)
- Changed: DX11 viewer & DX11 shaders now use less memory
- Changed: Improved .LAS parsing PointDataRecordFormats #2 & #3 are now supported
- Changed: With PointCloud2Mesh you dont need to select import format anymore, instead parser tries to read any suitable point cloud data (in common formats)
- Changed: Progress bar now also display during mesh saving
- Changed: Deleted 20 mesh clouds from "scene_mobile_heavy01.scene" to make it lighter

- Fixed: PointCloud2Mesh AutoOffset (it didnt work if FlipYZ was not enabled)
- Fixed: Fixed several parsing problems with some files (.asc, .pts, .las, .xyz)
- Fixed: .LAS colors values are now scaled to 0-255 (some files had different ranges)

- Note: DX11 Point clouds doesnt seem to work if Unity v5.x "[x] Virtual Reality Supported" is enabled
- Note: DX11 point clouds or Mesh point clouds doesnt seem to work with WebGL viewer

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

v1.5
- Added: ".LAS" import support for binary cloud converter *Only LAS format#2 is currently supported
- Added: ".PTS" import support for binary cloud converter (PTS: XYZ, XYZI, XYZIRGB, XYZRGB) *For now intensity value can be converted as RGB
- Added: "Window/PointCloudTools/Create test binary cloud" for creating random point clouds with adjustable point amount (for debug purposes)
- Added: "Window/PointCloudTools/Show header data helper" for printing out text based file headers (for debug purposes, to see what the file contains, ascii only)
- Added: "isLoading" boolean to check if we are still in loading

- Changed: Added "rotateWithRightMouse" bool into "SimpleSmoothMouseLook.cs", so you can rotate view while right mouse button is down
- Changed: BinaryViewer now automatically adds ".bin" to end of the file, if its missing in the inspector field
- Changed: .ASC reader now tries to skip all comment lines from start of the file (to allow reading Geomagic .asc files)

- Fixed: Manual offset values (had .x for all axis, instead of .x .y .z)
- Fixed: BinaryConverter now removes double or triple spaces between values, to fix Geomagic .asc import

- Note: MeshConverter does not yet support .LAS or .PTS importing (use some external tools to convert them to another supported format)


*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

v1.4
- Added: Brekel Binary & Animated Frames viewer support (Experimental)
- Added: Brekel Binary Animated Frames to Mesh conversion support (Experimental)
- Added: Mobile demo scene (using meshes) "scene_mobile_heavy01.scene"

- Changed: Faster binary loading *If you experience out of memory problems, do let me know! *2gb is max file size..


*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

v1.3
- Added: WebplayerViewerDX11 (loads binary file from url using WWW)
- Added: Import normals (PLY format only and PointCloud2MeshConverter only. Not for DX11 yet)
- Added: Shader+Materials with normals (PointCloudColorsNormalsMesh)

- Starting to cleanup "BinaryViewerDX11", moved code from Start() into ReadPointCloud()


*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

v1.2
- Fixed: PointCloud2MeshConverter failed to save mesh, if point amount was less than given vertex limit amount


*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

v1.1
- Initial release
